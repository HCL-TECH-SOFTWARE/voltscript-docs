# Introduction to VoltScript

This workshop is designed to walk through working with VoltScript from creating a simple script to a full project, including unit tests.

- [Lab 01](lab-01.md) creates a simple script to print "Hello World".
- [Lab 02](lab-02.md) creates a project with recommended structuring and including an external library module.
- [Lab 03a](lab-03a.md) leverages dependency management to build a project that downloads VoltScript Extensions and Library Modules.
- [Lab 03b](lab-03b.md) continues [Lab 03a](lab-03a.md); using VoltScript Extensions to parse raw JSON into objects, followed by writing and using unit tests.
- [Lab 04](lab-04.md) demonstrates authenticating with an HCL Domino REST API instance and connecting to a named Scope. (Requires DRAPI instance)
- [Lab 05](lab-05.md) uses the `VoltScriptJsonConverter` Extension to process raw JSON data into JSON document records.  
- [Lab 06](lab-06.md) builds on the skills from Lab 04 and Lab 05 in order to create Customer and Contact records in an HCL Domino REST API database. (Requires DRAPI instance)

!!! note
    This workshop covers writing code to be run **locally**, without requirement for a Volt Foundry server or payload.
