# Introduction to Writing VoltScript in Volt Foundry

This workshop is designed to walk through creating integration services by writing the VoltScript code directly in Volt Foundry.

- [Lab 01](lab-01.md) creates a simple integration service to return a message element "Hello World".
- [Lab 02](lab-02.md) creates an integration service to echo the username passed and error if nothing is passed.
- [Lab 03](lab-03.md) creates an integration service to update DRAPI data using an existing identity service for OAuth token.
