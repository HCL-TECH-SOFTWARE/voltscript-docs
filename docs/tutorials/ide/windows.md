# VoltScript on Windows

On Windows, you can use VoltScript natively. If Volt Foundry is installed on Windows, it is recommended that you develop also on Windows.

## Prerequisites

The only pre-requisite for using VoltScript is:

- Installing Visual Studio Code.

!!! info
    On Windows, you do not have to develop in a dev container, but can. The most obvious use case for this will be if Volt Foundry is running on Linux and wanting to develop on the same architecture. If you wish to follow this approach, the steps are the same as for [dev containers](devcontainer.md).

## Installing on Windows

1. Download the VoltScript installer file from [My HCLSoftware](https://my.hcltechsw.com/).
1. Run the VoltScript installer, installing to your desired location, for example C:\Program Files\VoltScript.

!!! note
    If you previously installed VoltScript via a zip and manually added the PATH environment variable, you will need to manually remove the old PATH environment variable.
