# Foundry Lab 03 - Domino REST API Integration Service

## Duration 40 Min

## What you will learn

You'll learn how to perform actions on data from Domino.

The first endpoint will be to populate a Domino database with demo data, which could subsequently be used as a REST service to bulk create documents based on a similar format - a process that might historically have been done by emailing a CSV file to the Domino developer who would run an import agent.

The next endpoint will change the company name on a Company document and update the name on related Contact documents. In Notes Client, this would be performed in a PostSave event. In a traditional Domino web interface, this would be completed in a WebQuerySave agent. In an XPages application, the PostSave event could be used, but more experienced developers would follow a similar approach to what we build here - write code to update the Company and update the related Contact documents. A completely coded approach could also be taken in Notes Client, but would use NotesUIWorkspace's Prompt or DialogBox to retrieve the new company name. But as we've explained, interaction with the end user is not possible from Volt Foundry.

!!! note
    The key difference with code running on a Domino server is the approach for updating related documents: in LotusScript / SSJS / Java the developer will retrieve a view, get all documents based on a key and iterate the collection. Obviously that is a sub-optimal approach when the code is running anywhere other than the Domino server - separate HTTP requests are required for retrieving the collection and updating each document. DQL allows updates on multiple documents and this is the process used by Domino REST API's bulk update endpoints. This is the best-practice approach because the query for related documents and update is performed on the Domino server.

## Prerequisites

- This exercise assumes that:

    - You're familiar with creating VoltScript integration services, as covered in Foundry Labs 01 and 02.
    - You have a Domino server configured with Domino REST API running and OAuth enabled.
        - The [oauth.nsf has been set up](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/howto/VoltMX/setupoauthnsf.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
        - The [oauth.json has been added to keepconfig.d](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/howto/IdP/configuredrapiIdP.html#procedure){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
    - You're familiar with creating a scope, schema and application in Domino REST API.

## Steps

### Schema / Scope

!!! note
    The following steps assume you're familiar with creating schemas and scopes using Domino REST API. For more information, see the [Domino REST API tutorials](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Domino-rest-api/tutorial/index.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

    If you have have already completed [Intro to VoltScript > Lab 04 - Connecting to a DRAPI Scope](../walkthrough/lab-04.md), go ahead and skip to the next section: [Application and Oauth](#application).

1. Download the [Demo Companies and Contacts Template](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/voltscript-samples/blob/main/samples/intro-lab4/assets/compcont.ntf){: target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer‚Äù} and save it locally.  
1. Create a New Database instance from the template on the HCL Domino server upon which your HCL Domino REST API is installed, and set the ACL appropriately for your DRAPI instance.  
1. Create a Scope called `companiesandcontacts`, and associate it with the `demo_companies_and_contacts` Schema in your newly created database.

        }
        ```

#### VoltScript Dependency Manager

1. From the **Command Palette** in VS Code, run "VoltScript: Run Dependency Setup".  
This will ensure that (among other things) a **.vss** folder is created within your VoltScript workspace.  

1. From the **Command Palette**, run "VoltScript: Install Dependencies".
1. Enter the project directory, confirm atlas-settings.json and atlas.json locations.

!!! success
    Your project should now have "src", "test", "libs", and "vses" directories.

    - The src directory is empty.
    - The test directory is empty.
    - The libs directory has been populated with `VoltScriptJsonConverter.vss`, `VoltMXObjects.vss` and `VoltScriptCollections.vss`. VoltScriptCollections is a downstream dependency of VoltMXObjects.
    - The vses directory has been populated with ddl and so files for DrapiVSE, ContextVSE, JsonVSE - these are downstream dependencies used by VoltMXObjects, automatically picked up because of its atlas.json.
    - A new file, `seti.ini`, has been created. This contains mapping for the VoltScript Extensions (VSEs) and will be used for mapping `UseVSE` statements.
    - A new file, `effective-atlas.json`, has been added to the root of the directory. This contains the aggregated settings for the project.

#### demo data

1. Create a file in the **src** directory called `demodata.json`.
1. Paste in the JSON from [company-contacts.json](../../assets/downloads/company-contacts.json){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
1. Save the file.

#### Contact class

1. Create a file in **libs** directory called `functions.vss`. This will hold reusable code.
1. Set `Option Public` and `Option Declare`.
1. Add `Use "VoltMXObjects"` and `Use "VoltScriptJsonConverter"` directives.
1. Create a class called `Contact`.
1. Declare four public string variables - `firstName`, `lastName`, `email` and `company`.

#### Company class

1. In `functions.vss` create a class called `Company`.
1. Declare two public string variables - `company` and `address`.
1. Declare a public variant variable - `contacts`.
1. Add a sub called `addToJsonArray` taking a single argument `jsonArr as JsonObject`.
1. Add the following code:

    ``` voltscript
    Dim childDoc as JsonObject
    Dim mainDoc as New JsonObject()

    Call mainDoc.insertValue("Form", "Company")
    Call mainDoc.insertValue("Company", Me.company)
    Call mainDoc.insertValue("Address", me.address)
    Call jsonArr.appendToJsonArray(mainDoc)

    ForAll contact in contacts
        Set childDoc = new JsonObject()
        Call childDoc.insertValue("Form", "Contact")
        Call childDoc.insertValue("Company", Me.company)
        Call childDoc.insertValue("FirstName", contact.firstName)
        Call childDoc.insertValue("LastName", contact.lastName)
        Call childDoc.insertValue("Email", contact.email)
        Call jsonArr.appendToJsonArray(childDoc)
    End ForAll
    ```

#### convertJson function

1. In `functions.vss` create a function called `convertJson()` that takes no arguments and returns a JsonObject.
1. For the body of the function, enter:

    ``` voltscript
    Dim jsonObj as JsonObject
    Dim temp as JsonObject
    Dim company as Company

    Dim parser as New JsonParser()
    Dim docs as New JsonObject(True)
    Dim helper as New JsonConversionHelper()
    Dim contactConverter as New JsonBasicObjectArrayConverter("Contact", "../libs/functions")

    ' Load file
    Call parser.loadFromFile(PROJECT_DIR & "/src/demodata.json")
    Set jsonObj = parser.getRootObject()

    'Deserialize Customers
    Call helper.withCustomConverter("contacts", contactConverter)
    ForAll child in jsonObj.getChildren()
        Set temp = child
        Set company = helper.toObject(temp, "Company", "../libs/functions").fromJson(temp)
        Call company.addToJsonArray(docs)
    End ForAll

    Return docs
    ```

1. Save the file.

The code loads the JSON and seeds a `JsonConversionHelper` with a `BasicObjectArrayConverter` to convert the `contacts` array to `Contact` objects. This only populates the first name, last name, and email. The code iterates each JSON object and creates a `Company` object for each, populating company, address and the contacts.

#### populate.vss

1. Create a file called `populate.vss` in src directory.
1. Type "foundry" and accept the Foundry Boilerplate snippet.
1. Add a directive to use the `DrapiVSE` VoltScript Extension
1. Add a directive to use functions library you just saved.
1. Add the following declarations at the top of the `Sub Initialize`:

    ``` voltscript
    Dim docs as JsonObject
    Dim request as DrapiRequest
    Dim responseObj as JsonObject

    Dim payload as New JsonObject()
    Dim server as New DrapiServer()
    Dim parser as new JsonParser()

    Dim response as DrapiResponse

    Dim username as String 
    Dim password as String 
    ```

1. Add the following code between the `START OF FOUNDRY HANDLER` and `END OF FOUNDRY HANDLER`:

    ``` voltscript
    server.serverURL = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("serverURL")
    username = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("username")
    password = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("password")
    
    Call server.login(username, password)

    Set request = server.createRequest("companiesandcontacts")
    Set docs = convertJson()
    Call payload.insertValue("documents", docs)

    Set response = request.bulkCreateDocuments(payload.toString(false))
    Call parser.loadFromJson(response.ContentBody)
    Set responseObj = parser.getRootObject()
    
    VoltMxResult.httpStatusCode = 200
    Call VoltMXResult.result.insertValue("result", responseObj.childCount & " docs created")
    ```

1. Save the file.

!!! info
    In this exercise we will be logging into Foundry with named credentials. This simulates authenticating with a service account. These credentials could be provided in multiple ways:

    - passed into each request (not recommended).
    - session variables set during a basic authentication call to Foundry.
    - request variables retrieved during a preprocessor from environment variables or other stored location.
    - session variables lazy-loaded during a preprocessor.
    - hard-coded credentials in the script, as done here. Admins may wish to add more restricted access to Foundry console to secure the credentials.

    If you want to run as the current user, the better approach would be to use an **Identity Service**, as you would have done if you have configured Domino Adapter for other Volt MX Go tutorials. This will be done in the [Identity Service and DRAPI tutorial](../vs-in-foundry/lab-03.md#configure-an-identity-service).

#### Package for Volt Foundry

1. From the **Command Palette**, run "VoltScript: Package for Foundry".
1. Enter the project directory.
1. Confirm atlas.json locations.
1. Enter `src/demodata.json` for additional files to package.

!!! success
    A file will be created in the root of the project called "foundry-lab.1.0.0.zip". The zip name comprises the project name and the project version from the atlas.json.

#### Create Volt Foundry Integration Service

1. Log into Volt Foundry.
1. On the **Apps** page, click **ADD NEW**.
1. On **Configure Services** tab, click the **Integration** tab and then click **CONFIGURE NEW**.

    ![CONFIGURE NEW](../../assets/images/tutorials/vs-in-foundry/integration-configurenew.png)

1. Set the **Name** to "foundry-drapi-vs".
1. Select "VoltScript" for **Service Type**.
1. Click **Upload New** and select the zip file you just created.
1. Click **SAVE & ADD OPERATION**.
1. Set the name to "populate".
1. Select "populate.vss" as the file.
1. Click **ADD OPERATION**.
1. Scroll down to the **Request Input** tab and click **+ Add Parameter**.
1. Set the **NAME** to `serverURL`.
1. Set the **TEST VALUE** to your domino server's Domino REST API base url, for example `http://localhost:8880/api/v1`.

    !!! note
        The URL needs to end with `/api/v1`.

1. Add a parameter for `username` and set the **TEST VALUE** to your username for your DRAPI Server.  
1. Add a parameter for `password` and set the **TEST VALUE** to your password for your DRAPI Server.
1. Verify that the **ENCODE** checkbox for all parameters is checked.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the operation and click **SAVE AND FETCH RESPONSE**.
1. On **Identity Backed Response** tab, click **AUTHORIZE** to authenticate to the Domino REST API.

    !!! success
        The output result shows the following JSON object:

        ```json
        {
            "result": "739 docs created",
            "opstatus": 0,
            "httpStatusCode": 200
        }
        ```

    !!! tip
        Verify by opening the database with Notes Client / Nomad Web. The "companies" view will have Company documents in it. The "contacts" view will have Contact documents which have the company name. This process can be used to seed a test database with demo documents or, by passing a JSON payload, it can be used to replace an import agent with a REST service endpoint.

    !!! advanced
        Further enhancements are possible:

        - Add proper error handling.
        - Unit testing could be added to test the `convertJson` function.
        - You could test the main code to populate the database. You would move it into a function, with the `DrapiServer()` object and variables passed. The `DrapiServer` would need to be manually logged in using `DrapiServer.login(*username*,*password*)` before being passed to the function.
        - The REST service can be enhanced further to validate the incoming JSON, in the same way that an import agent would validate each line of a CSV file. VoltScript Testing Framework can be used to perform validation

#### update.vss

1. Create a file called `update.vss` in src directory.
1. Type "foundry" and accept the Foundry Boilerplate snippet.
1. Add directives to use the `DrapiVSE` VoltScript Extension and the functions library.
1. Add the following declarations at the top of the `Sub Initialize`:

    ``` voltscript
    Dim request as DrapiRequest
    Dim doc as DrapiDocument
    Dim companyPayload as JsonObject

    Dim parser as New JsonParser()
    Dim server as New DrapiServer()
    Dim replaceItems as New JsonObject()

    Dim response as DrapiResponse
    Dim newCompanyName As String
    Dim oldCompanyName As String
    Dim query as String
    Dim unid as String

    Dim username as String 
    Dim password as String
    ```

1. Between the two comment blocks, enter the following code:

    ``` voltscript
    unid = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("unid")
    newCompanyName = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("CompanyName")
    server.serverURL = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("serverURL")
    username = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("username")
    password = VoltMXRequest.getInputParam("password")
    Call server.login(username, password)

    Set request = server.createRequest("foundrycontacts")
    Set doc = request.getDocument(unid)

    Call parser.loadFromJson(doc.JsonValue)
    Set companyPayload = parser.getRootObject()
    oldCompanyName = companyPayload.getChild("Company").scalarValue
    Call companyPayload.insertValue("Company", newCompanyName)
    doc.JsonValue = companyPayload.toString(false)
    Call VoltMxResult.result.insertValue("companyUpdated", doc.put("", "default"))

    query = "Form = 'Contact' and Company = '" & oldCompanyName & "'"
    Call replaceItems.insertValue("Company", newCompanyName)
    Set response = request.bulkPatchDocuments(query, replaceItems.toString(false), "html", "default", 5000, True, True)
    Call parser.loadFromJson(response.ContentBody)
    VoltMxResult.httpStatusCode = 200
    Call VoltMxResult.result.insertValue("contactsUpdated", parser.getRootObject())
    ```

1. Save the file.

#### Re-Package for Volt Foundry

1. From the **Command Palette**, run "VoltScript: Package for Foundry".
1. Enter the project directory.
1. Confirm atlas.json locations.
1. Enter `src/demodata.json` for additional files to package.

!!! success
    A file is created in the root of the project called "foundry-lab.1.0.0.zip". The zip name comprises the project name and the project version from the atlas.json.

#### Update the Integration Service

1. Log into Volt Foundry.
1. On the **Apps** page, select the app you created.
1. On **Configure Services** tab, click the **Integration** tab.
1. Click the **Service Definition** tab for the "foundry-drapi-vs" integration service.
1. Click **Upload New** and select the zip file you just created. You will receive a warning that this will update the endpoint operations. Click **OK**.
1. Click **SAVE & ADD OPERATION**.
1. Set the name to "update".

1. Click **ADD OPERATION**.
1. Scroll down to the **Request Input** tab and click **+ Add Parameter**.
1. Add the parameters for `serverURL`, `username`, and `password` in the same manner as you did for the **populate** service.
1. Click **+ Add Parameter** and set the **NAME** to `unid`.
1. Copy the UNID of a Company document in the Domino database.
1. Set the **TEST VALUE** to the UNID.
1. Click **+ Add Parameter** and set the **NAME** to `CompanyName`.
1. Set the **TEST VALUE** to a modified company name.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the operation and click **SAVE AND FETCH RESPONSE**.

    !!! success
        The output result shows a JSON object with:

        - `httpStatusCode` set to 200.
        - `companyUpdated` set to `true`.
        - `contactsUpdated` containing a JSON object of results for each contact update - UNID, success message, and status details.
